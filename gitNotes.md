# GITHUB GIT GITKRAKEN 

#### Vocab/lingo 

* Repo (repository): Git folder (It's the code base) 
* "local" is what is on your machine (creating a 
* "remote" is what is in the cloud 
* "push" is sending the new code to the remote (cloud) 
* "pull" taking new code to the local (your machine/computer) 
* Commit: to make a 'save' permanent. Telling Git where you want to make a save 
* Branch: a way to copy another part of code (you can copy another branch or the master to work with that code, make edits, and see how it will effect the base/main code) 
* Almost always working on branches, developing a new feature, then merging them into the master 
* Merge: bringing any edits made in the 'branch' back to the main code or master. Only adds in the edits and changes you've made 
* `.gitignore` : add this folder directly through the visual studio and add (exactly as written) the name of the folder or doc you want to have 'hidden' or ignored. 
* `README.md` : very useful to explain what your project is about, add photos, etc. (the 'md' means markdown)
