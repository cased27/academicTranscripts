# Academic History Log - Web Development
This is a log of my academic history with many of the tools I have used to learn front-end web development <br>

### Personal Coding History - When it started
I started coding in late 2017 in Granada, Spain where I had been living and teaching English to young kids. After my friend and collegue returned from summer vacation he excitedly shared his newfound interest in coding. The mental challenge coding presented was exciting. Unfortuantely many life events distracted me from my studies. It wasn't until early 2020 that I was able to refocus and restart learning to code. When COVID-19 hit I was well underway of having a coding routine. Now I code nearly every day working on projects, taking courses, and reading in order to help expand my knowledge and skills.

## Extra Goals
* Learn to setup your own local developement environment
* Deploy completed projects using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [surge.sh](http://surge.sh/) (Both front-end only) Or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) (Works with back-end too)
* Learn about build tools like [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and include them in projects
* Learn about linting. Use linters like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for Javascript , [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for CSS in your projects.
* Learn about CSS conventions like [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/book/).
* Every week, write a medium post about that week's learnings.
* Make a habit of coding daily. Try [#100DaysofCode Challenge](http://100daysofcode.com/)
