# Academic History - Web Development
Below is a log of my academic history to help keep track of the tools I have used to learn front-end web development <br>

#### Personal Coding History - When it started
I started coding in late 2017 in Granada, Spain where I had been living and teaching English to young kids. After my friend and collegue returned from summer vacation he excitedly shared his newfound interest in coding. I dabbled with FCC and enjoyed the mental challenge but to my dismay, due to a number of life events, I was unable to continue my coding education. It wasn't until late 2019 / early 2020 that I was able to refocus and restart learning to code. When the global pandemic of COVID-19 hit I was well underway of having a coding routine which was amplified and reinforced by the lockdown. Now I code nearly every day working on projects, taking courses, and reading in order to help expand my knowledge and skills with basic coding languages.

## Extra Goals
* Learn to setup your own local developement environment
* Deploy completed projects using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [surge.sh](http://surge.sh/) (Both front-end only) Or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) (Works with back-end too)
* Learn about build tools like [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and include them in projects
* Learn about linting. Use linters like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for Javascript , [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for CSS in your projects.
* Learn about CSS conventions like [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/book/).
* Every week, write a medium post about that week's learnings.
* Make a habit of coding daily. Try [#100DaysofCode Challenge](http://100daysofcode.com/)
